I started a blog.
This is it.
Not because I think I’m anything special.
Just because I like to write and it’s a free country, right? (#merica)

I’m 36 years old (for now), and I’ve lived a lot of life.
I often get caught up in my own head.
I’m learning that it feels good to write out my thoughts.

But who even am I?
I’m a husband & dad.
I’m a designer.
I’m a wrestling fan.

I’ve had a bunch of blogs over the years. All the way back to my Xanga when I was 20 where I posted all the emo poems I wrote. Sheesh. I have a Tumblr for sharing cool visual things, but decided it was time to exercise my creative writing muscle.

This blog isn’t special.
It won’t always be profound or necessary.
But because of technology and social media we all have a digital voice.
This is mine. Enjoy!
